#GravitySim
A simulation of gravity at celestial scales, with two large objects creating gravitational fields, and one small "satellite" that moves through it.

Up arrow makes the satellite move at a constant 100 px/s, down arrow makes it move at 10 px/s, left arrow gives it a constant acceleration perpendicular to its velocity and to its left,
right arrow does the same but to the right.

The "o" key will make the satellite orbit the closest object.
